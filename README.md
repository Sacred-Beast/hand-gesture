[Hand Gesture Recognition Project]

## Overview
This project implements hand gesture recognition using a webcam. It includes scripts for debugging the camera, testing webcam functionality, and recognizing hand gestures in real-time.

## Features
- Real-time hand gesture detection
- Webcam testing and debugging utilities
- Modular Python scripts for easy experimentation

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- Other dependencies as required by your scripts

## Setup

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Install required packages:
	 ```
	 pip install opencv-python
	 ```
	 Add any other dependencies as needed.

## Usage

- To test your webcam:
	```
	python test_webcam.py
	```
- To debug camera settings:
	```
	python debug_cam.py
	```
- To run hand gesture recognition:
	```
	python hand_gesture.py
	```
